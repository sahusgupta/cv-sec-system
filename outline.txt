Workflow:
 - Chrome Extension Architecture
 - Screen Capturing
 - OpenCV Processing
 - Teacher Integration and UI
 - Dev Setup
 - LTI Integration
 
 Development Setup


Create Chrome extension project structure
Configure manifest.json
Set up development environment
Install necessary dependencies


Screen Capture Implementation


Request screen capture permissions
Implement capture mechanism
Convert captured image to processable format


OpenCV Integration


Load OpenCV.js library
Create image processing functions
Implement analysis algorithms
Handle image transformation/analysis


Canvas LTI Integration


Use Canvas API for authentication
Create communication layer between extension and Canvas
Handle data transmission securely


User Interface


Design minimal UI for extension controls
Implement user interaction for capture/process
Provide feedback on processing results


Security Considerations


Implement secure authentication
Manage user permissions
Protect sensitive screen capture data

Testing & Deployment

Comprehensive testing across scenarios
