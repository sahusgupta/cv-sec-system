Project Overview
Build a security system that can:

Detect and track people/objects in real-time
Recognize faces and identify known individuals
Detect suspicious activities
Generate natural language descriptions of events
Respond to text queries about past events
Provide real-time alerts with AI-generated explanations

Week 1: Setup and Basic Motion Detection (Done)
    - Reading: OpenCV documentation
    - Project: Basic Motion Detection and env setup
Week 2: Researching LLM Architecture (In progress)
    - Reading: "Scalable MatMul-Free LLMs"
    - Project: Recreate the experiment from the central paper
Week 3: Researching CNN Operations and Activation Functions
    - Reading: activation functions for neural nets and neural nets from scratch
    - Project: idk yet but i need to learn it
Week 4: Construct Transformer For LLM
    - Reading: building transformers from scratch
    - Project: implement the transformer for AI-generated descriptions
Week 5: Databasing for Past Events
    - Reading: None
    - Project: Setup Postgres / Firebase database for logging events
Week 6: Facial Recognition
    - Reading: what are MTCNNs?
    - Project: Build a face recognizer to detect unknown faces and identify known people
Week 7: Action Detection
    - Reading: None
    - Project: classify suspicious events
Week 8: Alert System
